- Text nodes only, except the opt-in "media" shape: local deterministic SVG files and Markdown notes embedding them (no raster images, PDFs, video, iframes or remote content).
- A* routing only when --astar-percent > 0 and never in native mode; fork/upstream route dirty edges on render, so with A* edges load and drags include routing.
- Load is file open inside a running Obsidian, not a cold application start.
- JS heap is performance.memory (Chromium, non-standard) without forced GC; treat as indicative.
- Frame timings depend on monitor refresh rate, window size and focus; idle frame baseline is reported for normalization.
